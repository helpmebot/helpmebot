##Database configuration

You need a file called `database.config` in the same folder as Helpmebot.exe. This file needs to contain something like the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<database hostname="dbmaster.srv.stwalkerster.net" port="3306" username="stwalkerster" password="s3cret" schema="helpmebot_devel" />
```
