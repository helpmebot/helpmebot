This folder contains statically-defined pages for the Web UI.

All files ending *.md will be loaded and parsed, and as such these files need to follow a specific format - effectively
a Markdown document with YAML front matter.

This means the file should look something like this, with the Markdown page content starting after the second "---":

---
title: Page title goes here
path: path/to/location/on/website
---
Markdown content starts here


Two attributes are mandatory for the page to be loaded - the "title" and "path" attributes. The title attribute is used
as the page header and in the HTML title. The path attribute is used to determine where the page will be available, and
is anchored to the root of the website. Thus the page described above would be accessible at this address:
    https://helpmebot.org.uk/path/to/location/on/website
    
Two more attributes are optional: "icon" and "navigationTitle". These attributes are used if you want the page to appear
in the navigation sidebar.
