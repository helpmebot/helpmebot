    - - "All in one and one in all."
    - - "All we have is yours."
    - - "Calm yourself!"
    - - "Comes a man? It is! The Freeman!"
    - - "Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself."
    - - "Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share."
    - - "Far distant eyes look out through yours."
    - - "For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds."
    - - "How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass?"
    - - "How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again."
    - - "If you are truly the Freeman, we salute you."
    - - "Is this the Freeman we see before our eyes?"
    - - "Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow."
    - - "No pit is complete without a Freeman coming out of it."
    - - "Node and nexus, feed upon this life!"
    - - "Our cause seems hopeless."
    - - "Our life is worthless unless spent on freedom."
    - - "Our purpose is mutual."
    - - "Perhaps we will serve you better here."
    - - "Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it."
    - - "That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time."
    - - "The Combine will pay in kind for their depravity."
    - - "The way ahead is dark for the moment."
    - - "There is more to the Freeman than meets the eye."
    - - "There is no distance between us. No false veil of time or space may intervene."
    - - "This is more than anyone can bear, but we will persevere."
    - - "Undeserving of consciousness."
    - - "Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread."
    - - "We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it."
    - - "We are still here."
    - - "We are there still, in observance of your final stroke."
    - - "We are you, Freeman. And you are us."
    - - "We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash beyond the barriers."
    - - "We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us."
    - - "We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow."
    - - "We cannot read the Freeman's optical buds."
    - - "We dedicate ourselves to your purpose."
    - - "We deem this company inviolable."
    - - "We fear we have failed you."
    - - "We have dreamed of this moment."
    - - "We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable!"
    - - "We have lost all dear to us."
    - - "We have survived darker times."
    - - "We have survived worse across the ages."
    - - "We know you."
    - - "We never dreamed to meet you in corporeal form."
    - - "We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous."
    - - "We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber."
    - - "We serve the same mystery."
    - - "We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock."
    - - "We will put aside Black Mesa... for now."
    - - "What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness."
    - - "While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us."
    - - "With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh."
    - - "You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure."
    - - "You humans, always in the qualidity."
    - - "You must remember us from Black Mesa."
    - - "Your bright face obscures your darker mask."
    - - "Your companionship is greatly belabored."
    - - "Your mind is opaque."
    - - "Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle."
