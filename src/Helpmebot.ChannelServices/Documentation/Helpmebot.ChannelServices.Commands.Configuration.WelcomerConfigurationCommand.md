This command configures the channel welcomer. Any user who has a hostmask on the list (but not on the ignore list) will be greeted with the message at [Messages:WelcomeMessage/channel](https://helpmebot.org.uk/wiki/Messages:WelcomeMessage/channel) (for example, [Message:WelcomeMessage/wikipedia-en-help](https://helpmebot.org.uk/wiki/Messages:WelcomeMessage/wikipedia-en-help)) on their entry to the channel. As a fallback, it will use [Message:WelcomeMessage](https://helpmebot.org.uk/wiki/Messages:WelcomeMessage).

If there are no hostmasks in the list to be welcomed, then nobody will be welcomed.
